# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
A hypothetical car company's, AutosRUsâ€™, upper management has called on their employee, Jeremy, and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help their manufacturing team with their MechaCar prototypes. We like Jeremy and he is fairly new to R, the coding langauge that most of his firm uses; he's a good, albeit hypothetical, guy, so we are going to help him with his analysis.

## Overview
There is a lot for Jeremy and the Data Analytics team to do. Here are some of the questions we will help them answer and deliverables we will assist with: 

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- And, finally, we wiill help design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 
 
For each statistical analysis, there will be a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The multi-variable linear regression to predict mpg was successful at identifying statistially significant variables that contributed to miles per gallon (mpg). With that said, however, our analysis also had room for improvement. Please see the below for our exact findings; below that you will find my methodology and interpretation.

###### Regression Output Predicting MPG

To conduct this analysis, I used the miles per gallon dataset provided by 'management' and loaded it into a dataset. I used mpg as my dependent variable, and vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and all wheel drive (AWD) as independent variables. After executing the regression, I found that two variables had a non-random amount of variance / a correlation with mpg, and with a high level of confidence as that (denoted by the three asteriks). The significant variables were vehicle length and ground clearance. Taking these two statisitcally significant variables into account, I can confirm that the slope of the linear model is not/should not be considered zero. At a high level, the model predicts the mpg of the MechaCars with an accuracy rate of roughly 71%, denoted by our r-squared.


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The manufacturing team has a design specification requiring that the suspension coils maintain a varaiance that does not exceed 100 lbs per square inch (PSI); we reviewed a dataset provided on the suspension coils and using summary() and group_by() functions in R, we sought to investigate if the design specification requirement was being followed.

At a high level, we found that the variance followed the design specification. Below are the summary statistics for the all of the lot producing the MechaCar prototype.

###### Statistics for All Lots

However, upon furhter investigation into each individual lot, we also found that one of the three lots, Lot3 had a variance of 170 which did not meet the specification. Lot3's failure needs to be raised to management. The details for each lot are below.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
We performed four sepearate t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots were statistically different from the mean population concerning PSI. When analyzed at a high level, or rather all of the lots in the same t-test, and analyzed at the per lot level, the t-tests revealed that the the alternative hypothesis (that all or an individual lot did not have a mean PSI of 1500) could be rejected. The results of the four t-tests are below.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Post launch of the MechaCar, we will want to analyze the car's performance in the market against its competition. In order to do that, we will want to conduct further analysis. Some of the questions we will want to answer in that follow up analysis are as follows:
- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?

Here are some of the thoughts I have on those questions for the follow up study to come post MechaCar launch:
- What metric or metrics are you going to test?
   -  Number of Cars sold vs our other models vs other brands, mpg compared to competition, cost versus competition, where are most MechaCars being sold versus competition, features in the vehicle versus peers
- What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
   - The null hypothesis is that a successful launch of the car would equate to x number of sales in y time period across z-list of regions. The alternative would be that not meeting any or some of the criteria previously mentioned would mean that we could not reject the idea that we failed in some way we anticipated succeeding. 
- What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
   - Comparing the MechaCar to its competition requires a different analysis for each category I described. However, on the regional front and price front, I could use a bar chart comparing our sales and sale price with the sales of our competition. Another example would be mpg compared across models sold in a given period of time. I think a t test comparing our mpg versus the competition would help as well with determining if we are doing significantly better or worse than others and may best fit this question. This would make for pretty good marketing if we do better than our competition in a statistically significant way.
- What data is needed to run the statistical test?
   - We need sales data for our competitiors complete with models, price, sales dates, launch dates, region vehicle was sold in, and the same for our MechaCar.
