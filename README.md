# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
A hypothetical car company's, AutosRUsâ€™, upper management has called on their employee Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help their manufacturing team with their MechaCar prototypes. We like Jeremy; he's a good, albeit hypothetical, guy, so we are going to help him with his analysis.

## Overview
There is a lot for Jeremy and the Data Analytics team to do. First, here are some of the questions we will help them answer and deliverables we will assist with: 

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- And, finally, we wiill help design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 
 
For each statistical analysis, there will be a summary interpretation of the findings.
